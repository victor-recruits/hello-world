# hello-world

I am a recruiter from various fields and experiences, from an accounting & finance search firm, 
cannabis, technology and now Insurance. With Munich Re, I am excited to be part of a growing team here in Toronto, 
poised to make a global impact to disrupt and innovate the insurance industry. 

Building great relationships has been a theme across my career, whether be placing great people in great jobs, 
or through my lens and camera.
